All PEs experience the same average memory access time(independent of PE or accessed memory address)
â€¢Also known as Symmetric Multi-processors (SMPs)

PEs have to wait for bus to be available when they need to access memory. How to avoid this bottleneck?

Use local caches!

But what happens when a shared data block is fetched into separate local caches?
