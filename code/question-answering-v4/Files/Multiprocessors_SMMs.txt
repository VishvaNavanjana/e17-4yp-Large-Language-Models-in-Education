Most common method of multi-processor communication
•Memory sharing managed by shared OS
•Physical address space shared among PEs
•Workload balancing among PEs
•Without shared memory, each PE must have own OS copy in a private memory

Memory
•Sharing memory →memory contention!
•Classification (based on CPU’s perspective of memory):
-Uniform Memory Access (UMA)
-Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)
