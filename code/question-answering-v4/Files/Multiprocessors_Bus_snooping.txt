Dedicated bus for coherency control.At every write access, cache controllers share addresses through the snoop bus.Each cache listens to the snoop bus,to check “if other caches are updating blocks that I also have cached”.Write-invalidate protocols:invalidate own copyNext access to same block is a miss!.Write-through caching: memory has up-to-date copy.Write-back caching: snoop in other caches to find most recent copy(more complex snooping, more snoop traffic, less memory traffic).Write-update protocols:update own copy (a.k.a. write-broadcast)Next access to same block is a hitNeed to share data+addressin snoop bus for every.write(Increased snoop bus lines → more power, less cache misses).
