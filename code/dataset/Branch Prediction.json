        "context": "Branch prediction is one of the ancient performance improving techniques which still finds relevance into modern architectures. While the simple prediction techniques provide fast lookup and power efficiency they suffer from high misprediction rate. On the other hand, complex branch predictions \u2013 either neural based or variants of two-level branch prediction \u2013 provide better prediction accuracy but consume more power and complexity increases exponentially. In addition to this, in complex prediction techniques the time taken to predict the branches is itself very high \u2013 ranging from 2 to 5 cycles \u2013 which is comparable to the execution time of actual branches. Branch prediction is essentially an optimization (minimization) problem where the emphasis is on to achieve lowest possible miss rate, low power consumption and low complexity with minimum resources. There really are three different kinds of branches: \u00a7 Forward conditional branches - based on a run-time condition, the PC (Program Counter) is changed to point to an address forward in the instruction stream. \u00a7 Backward conditional branches - the PC is changed to point backward in the instruction stream. The branch is based on some condition, such as branching backwards to the beginning of a program loop when a test at the end of the loop states the loop should be executed again. \u00a7 Unconditional branches - this includes jumps, procedure calls and returns that have no specific condition. For example, an unconditional jump instruction might be coded in assembly language as simply \"jmp\", and the instruction stream must immediately be directed to the target location pointed to by the jump instruction, whereas a conditional jump that might be coded as \"jmpne\" would redirect the instruction stream only if the result of a comparison of two values in a previous \"compare\" instructions shows the values to not be equal. (The segmented addressing scheme used by the x86 architecture adds extra complexity, since jumps can be either \"near\" (within a segment) or \"far\" (outside the segment). Each type has different effects on branch prediction algorithms.)",

To refine our branch prediction, we could create a buffer that is indexed by the low-order address bits of recent branch instructions. In this BHB (sometimes called a \"Branch History Table (BHT)\"), for each branch instruction, we'd store a bit that indicates whether the branch was recently taken. A simple way to implement a dynamic branch predictor would be to check the BHB for every branch instruction. If the BHB's prediction bit indicates the branch should be taken, then the pipeline can go ahead and start fetching instructions from the new address (once it computes the target address). By the time the branch instruction works its way down the pipeline and actually causes a branch, then the correct instructions are already in the pipeline.

        "context": "Combined branch prediction* Scott McFarling proposed combined branch prediction in his 1993 paper 2. Combined branch prediction is about as accurate as local prediction, and almost as fast as global prediction. Combined branch prediction uses three predictors in parallel: bimodal, gshare, and a bimodal-like predictor to pick which of bimodal or gshare to use on a branch-by-branch basis. The choice predictor is yet another 2-bit up\/down saturating counter, in this case the MSB choosing the prediction to use. In this case the counter is updated whenever the bimodal and gshare predictions disagree, to favor whichever predictor was actually right. On the SPEC'89 benchmarks, such a predictor is about as good as the local predictor. Another way of combining branch predictors is to have e.g. 3 different branch predictors, and merge their results by a majority vote. Predictors like gshare use multiple table entries to track the behavior of any particular branch. This multiplication of entries makes it much more likely that two branches will map to the same table entry (a situation called aliasing), which in turn makes it much more likely that prediction accuracy will suffer for those branches. Once you have multiple predictors, it is beneficial to arrange that each predictor will have different aliasing patterns, so that it is more likely that at least one predictor will have no aliasing. Combined predictors with different indexing functions for the different predictors are called gskew predictors, and are analogous to skewed associative caches used for data and instruction caching. * From : http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Branch_prediction",

By storing the instruction address and the target address, even before the processor decodes the instruction, it can know that it is a branch. A large BTB can completely remove most branch penalties (for correctly-predicted branches) if the CPU looks far enough ahead to make sure the target instructions are pre-fetched. Using a Return Address Buffer to predict the return from a subroutine One technique for dealing with the unconditional branch at the end of a subroutine is to create a buffer of the most recent return addresses. There are usually some subroutines that get called quite often in a program, and a return address buffer can make sure that the correct instructions are in the pipeline after the return instruction.
